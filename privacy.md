Firefox Lockbox allows Firefox Accounts users to access their login and password information (which we call “credentials”) on their mobile phones, outside any browser, by using Firefox Sync. The [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) describes how we handle information that we receive from you. In order to use Firefox Lockbox, you must also use Firefox. You can find information about how we handle information in Firefox, including the Sync feature, in the [Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/).

Here are the other key things you should know about how Firefox Lockbox’s handles your data:

- Credential data: Your credentials are synced in encrypted form using Firefox Sync. Interaction data. Mozilla receives information about your interaction with Firefox Lockbox, including (1) frequency of editing, viewing, copying, and syncing credentials, (2) whether you are a new or existing Firefox Account user, (3) interactions with Firefox Lockbox menus and icons, (4) length of time the app is in background.
- Technical data. We receive your device, operating system, version, and language preference. We also receive your IP address in connection with your usage of a Firefox Account.
- Other Mozilla Services. Firefox Lockbox requires a Firefox Account and uses the Firefox Sync service.
