Firefox Lockbox allows Firefox Accounts users to access the login and password information (which we call “credentials”) on their mobile phones, outside any browser, by using Firefox Sync. In addition to the [data](https://testpilot.firefox.com/privacy) collected by all Test Pilot experiments, here are the key things you should know about Firefox Lockbox’s data collection:

- Credential data: Your credentials are synced in encrypted form using Firefox Sync. Learn more [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#sync).
- Interaction data. Mozilla receives information about your interaction with Firefox Lockbox, including (1) frequency of editing, viewing, copying, and syncing credentials, (2) whether you are a new or existing Firefox Account user, (3) interactions with Firefox Lockbox menus and icons, (4) length of time the app is in background.
- Technical data. We receive your device, operating system, version, and language preference. We also receive your IP address in connection with your usage of a Firefox Account. Learn more [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#search).
- Third-Party Services. We use Apple's TestFlight for beta testing, which has separate [Legal](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/testflight/sren/terms.html) and [Privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) terms. Apple receives crash data by default, which may include personally identifiable data, and which may be sent to Mozilla.
- Other Mozilla Services. Unlike most Test Pilot experiments, Firefox Lockbox requires a Firefox Account and uses the Firefox Sync service. Learn more about [Firefox Accounts](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/), and [Sync](https://moz-services-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/).
