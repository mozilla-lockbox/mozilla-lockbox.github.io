## What is Firefox Lockbox?

Firefox Lockbox is an experimental product from Mozilla, the makers of Firefox.  It’s a tool that allows you to access saved passwords from your mobile phone.  Right now, it’s available for iPhone, and we hope to make it available on Android soon.  

## How do I use Firefox Lockbox?

Firefox Lockbox works by syncing passwords between the Firefox browser and the Firefox Lockbox app. To get started, sign in to your account on Firefox for desktop or mobile and begin saving your logins to Firefox when prompted.  You’ll need to save at least one login to Firefox to see your entries in Firefox Lockbox.  

## How do I enable sync on Firefox?

### On Desktop

To begin syncing between Firefox and the Firefox Lockbox app, you’ll need to log in or create a Firefox Account on Firefox for desktop.  You’ll find the login screen under Setting/Preferences (via the gear icon in the main menu).  Select the Logins item in the section titled Sync Settings to send your saved logins to Firefox Lockbox. 

### On iOS

To begin syncing between Firefox and the Firefox Lockbox app, you’ll need to log in to your Firefox Account on Firefox for iOS.  You’ll find the login screen under Settings (via the gear icon in the main menu).  Once you are logged in to your account, you can select Sync Now to send your saved logins to Firefox Lockbox. 

If you haven’t saved any logins to Firefox for iOS, select the switch to Save Logins. Any new logins you save or edit on iOS will then sync with Firefox Lockbox. 

## How do I create new entries?

When you are logged into your Firefox Account on Firefox for desktop or mobile, every time you enter new login information, Firefox will prompt you to save these details. Your login information will then sync to Firefox Lockbox. 

## How do I edit existing entries?

You’ll need to edit entries in Firefox.  To do this in Firefox for desktop, go to Settings/Preferences, and under the Privacy & Security panel, select the Saved Logins button.  Double click on entry information to edit. 

To edit entries on Firefox for iOS, go to settings and select the Logins menu under the Privacy section.

## What security technology does Firefox Lockbox use?

When you protect Firefox Lockbox with a Firefox Account, Firefox Lockbox uses [AES256-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) encryption, a tamper-resistant block cipher technology, to protect your data.
