### What is Firefox Lockbox?

Firefox Lockbox is an experimental product from Mozilla, the makers of Firefox.  It’s a tool that allows you to access saved passwords from your mobile phone.  Right now, it’s available for iPhone, and we hope to make it available on Android soon.

### How do I get my Firefox saved logins into Firefox Lockbox?

Firefox Lockbox works by syncing passwords between the Firefox browser and the Firefox Lockbox app. To get started, [sign in or create a Firefox Account](#how-do-i-enable-sync-on-firefox) on Firefox for desktop or mobile to begin syncing your logins. You’ll need at least one saved login in Firefox to see your entries in Firefox Lockbox.

### How do I create new entries?

When you are logged into your Firefox Account on Firefox for desktop or mobile, every time you enter new login information, Firefox will prompt you to save these details. Your login information will then sync to Firefox Lockbox.

### How do I edit existing entries?

You’ll need to edit entries in Firefox.  To do this in Firefox for desktop, go to Settings/Preferences, and under the Privacy & Security panel, select the Saved Logins button.  Double click on entry information to edit.

<a id="what-security-technology-does-firefox-lockbox-use">
### What security technologies does Firefox Lockbox use?

Firefox Lockbox uses the following technologies to protect your data:

* [AES-256-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) encryption, a tamper-resistant block cipher technology.
* [onepw](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/wiki/onepw-protocol) protocol to sign into Firefox Accounts and obtain encryption keys.
* [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) and [HKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to create the encryption key from your Firefox Accounts username and password.

All of this is done on your device, so Mozilla cannot know your password and cannot read your data.
